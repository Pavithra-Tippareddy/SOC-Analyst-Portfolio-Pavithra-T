# Lab: ICMP Packet Capture with Wireshark

## Objective
Capture and analyze **ICMP traffic (Ping)** between Kali and Ubuntu.

---

## Setup
- Kali Linux → runs `ping`
- Ubuntu (victim) → responds to ICMP
- Wireshark running on Kali, interface: `eth0`

---

## Steps & Results

## Step 1: Start Wireshark
- Selected interface: `eth0`
- Applied filter:
icmp

---

## Step 2: Generate ICMP Traffic

ping -c 4 192.168.30.128
Step 3: Wireshark Capture
Saw Echo Request (from Kali → Ubuntu).

Saw Echo Reply (from Ubuntu → Kali).

## Findings
* ICMP round-trip verified.
* Packet headers showed:
* Source IP: Kali
* Destination IP: Ubuntu
* Protocol: ICMP

Type: 8 (Echo Request), Type: 0 (Echo Reply)

## SOC Analyst Notes
* ICMP can be used by attackers for:
* Host discovery (ping sweeps).
* Covert channels (data exfiltration).
* Analysts should monitor abnormal ICMP spikes.
